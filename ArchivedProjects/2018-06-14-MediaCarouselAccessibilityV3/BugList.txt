Verified the media carousel with frames component in FF and EDGE in Live. Below are the observations.

1.	While Navigating between pagination icons using right arrow key , video frame is not changing. Whereas using left arrow key video frame is getting changed.-Both FF and EDGE PFV
2.	While navigating the pagination icons using left arrow key, two pagination icons got selected with black dots and focus indicator is visible on only one dotted icon.  ----Only in FF. PFV
3.	Screen readers are not reading any instruction hoe to activate the tab item- Both FF and EDGE.
4.	In EDGE-During scan mode focus is not traversing on to carousals buttons by using down key but if we press up arrow key to reach carousals focus is reach to buttons but SR is narrating “Section region landmark”. As we mentioned previous and Aman commented as Expected Operation.
Note: Unable to test in IE as page is not at all rendering fine. Sticky Nav is not present in the page. PFA Screenshots for the same. But page is working fine in Edge & FF.


observed that arrow function is used in the code , I think it is ES5/6 concept perhaps not supported in IE which is actually blocking the other script and hence the UI issues (stickynav and media carousel with frame alignment issue), I tried to make it normal function, correct me if I am wrong . Also the function is declared inside the document.ready but called outside of it (which is un accessible) , kept the function outside. Below are the release details , please cross check  if you are okay then publish after a round of testing.w are the release details , please cross check  if you are okay then publish after a round of testing.
